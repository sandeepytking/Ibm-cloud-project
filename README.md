# âš¡ Power System Fault Detection and Classification

This project is built as part of the Edunet Foundation + IBM SkillsBuild Internship. It uses machine learning to detect and classify faults in power distribution systems based on real-world sensor and environmental data.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Power grids experience various types of faults (e.g., line breakage, overheating, transformer failure), and quick identification is critical to ensure safety and continuity. This system uses historical fault data to train a machine learning model that can classify fault types in real-time.
